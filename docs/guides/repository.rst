==============================

Queenbee repositories are essential to store and share Operators and Recipes that can be executed as Workflows.

A Repository is a folder that consists of an ``index.json`` index file and a series of packaged Operators and Recipes.
It is used to manager Recipe dependencies (which can be Operators or other Recipes).

In this section we will show you how to use Github to store your Recipes/Operators and then
share them with others with an Queenbee Repository living on your ``gh-pages`` branch.

Getting Started
---------------
You will need an empty repository to get started. You should create a new repository on
Github and then clone it to your local machine.

Once you have cloned it, open the folder with your preferred code editor.
